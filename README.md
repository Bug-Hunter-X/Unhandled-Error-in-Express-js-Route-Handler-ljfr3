# Express.js Unhandled Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  failure to handle invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows a route that doesn't properly handle cases where the user ID is not a valid integer. This can lead to unexpected crashes or errors.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.
